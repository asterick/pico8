Pico-8 javascript runtime
=========================

This is my quick and dirty reimplementation of the Pico-8 fantasy console

Known issues
------------
* sfx and music do nothing
* sspr spr and map do not draw anything
* GamePads are initalized, but not used (keyboard input preferred)
* btnp doesn't respect auto repeating
* stat/info do nothing currently
* DIR doesn't output in the same format (missing current directory name)
* Audio mixer doesn't have effects, is poorly tuned and is generally broken
